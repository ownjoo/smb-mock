## Quick start

```bash
docker compose up
```

Both containers start, the KDC initialises its database, exports the keytab, and Samba waits for the KDC healthcheck before binding port 445. The stack is ready when `docker compose up` returns.

Default credentials: **`testuser` / `testpass`**  
Default shares: **`testshare`** (read-write) · **`readonly`** (read-only)

> **Windows note:** Port 445 is owned by Windows. Use `SMB_PORT=4450` and add `127.0.0.1 smbserver.smbtest.local` to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

---

## Architecture

![Architecture: mock-kdc and mock-smb inside docker compose, connected via a shared krb5.keytab Docker volume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ownjoo/smb-mock/main/docs/architecture.svg)

Both containers write/read `/shared/krb5.keytab` via a shared Docker volume — the KDC exports it at startup, Samba waits for it before binding port 445.

Both containers are built on [Chainguard Wolfi](https://wolfi.dev/) — a minimal, purpose-built container OS with daily CVE patches and a near-zero known-vulnerability footprint.

---

## Containers

| Container | Image | Role | Ports |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|
| `mock-kdc` | `ownjooorg/mock-kdc` | MIT Kerberos KDC — issues tickets, writes keytab | 88/tcp+udp, 8088/tcp |
| `mock-smb` | `ownjooorg/mock-smb` | Samba smbd — serves SMB2/3 shares | 445/tcp |

Samba waits for the KDC healthcheck (`GET /healthz`) before starting. Port 749 (kadmind) is **not** exposed on the host — it stays inside the Docker network.

---

## Authentication methods

All methods are independently toggled via environment variables:

| Method | Env var | Default |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Anonymous / guest | `SMB_ENABLE_ANONYMOUS` | `true` |
| NTLMv2 | `SMB_ENABLE_NTLM` | `true` |
| Kerberos / SPNEGO | `SMB_ENABLE_KERBEROS` | `true` |

SMBv1 is **disabled**. SMBv2 and SMBv3 are enforced. NTLMv1 is **disabled**; NTLMv2 only.

---

## Configuration

All configuration flows in via environment variables — in a `.env` file, passed to `docker compose`, or set in your CI environment.

### Users

```
SMB_USER_0=alice:s3cret
SMB_USER_1=bob:s3cret2
```

Supports UPN format (`alice@REALM`) for both Kerberos and NTLM.

### Shares

```
SMB_SHARE_0=docs:/smb-data/docs:rw
SMB_SHARE_1=archive:/smb-data/archive:ro
```

Format: `name:path-in-container:rw|ro`

### Identity

```
SMB_HOSTNAME=smbserver.smbtest.local
SMB_WORKGROUP=SMBTEST
KRB5_REALM=SMBTEST.LOCAL
KRB5_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpass
```

### Ports

```
SMB_PORT=445        # host port → container 445
KDC_PORT=88         # host port → container 88 (tcp+udp)
KDC_HTTP_PORT=8088  # KDC keytab HTTP API
```

### SMB protocol tuning

```
SMB_MIN_PROTOCOL=SMB2        # default SMB2
SMB_MAX_PROTOCOL=SMB3        # default SMB3
SMB_SERVER_SIGNING=mandatory # auto | mandatory | disabled
SMB_NTLM_AUTH=ntlmv2-only   # ntlmv2-only | yes | no
SMB_LOG_LEVEL=0              # 0–10
SMB_MAX_LOG_SIZE=50          # KB
```

### KDC tuning

```
KDC_MAX_LIFE=10h 0m 0s
KDC_MAX_RENEWABLE_LIFE=7d 0h 0m 0s
KDC_SUPPORTED_ENCTYPES=aes256-cts:normal aes128-cts:normal
KDC_KEYTAB_PATH=/shared/krb5.keytab
```

### Wizards

**CLI wizard** — generates `.env`, `docker run` script, or compose override:

```bash
pip install -e ".[cli]"
smb-mock-wizard
```

**HTML wizard** — open `wizard.html` in a browser (no server required). Output updates live; download or copy the generated config.

---

## KDC keytab HTTP API

The KDC container exposes a lightweight HTTP server on port 8088:

```
GET http://<kdc-host>:8088/keytab   →  raw keytab bytes (application/octet-stream)
GET http://<kdc-host>:8088/healthz  →  200 ok once keytab is ready
```

The keytab is also emitted as a base64-encoded line to container stdout at startup:

```
KEYTAB_B64:<base64-encoded-keytab>
```

Consumers that cannot reach the HTTP endpoint can parse `docker logs` instead.

### Securing the keytab endpoint

By default `/keytab` requires no authentication. To require a bearer token:

```
KDC_HTTP_TOKEN=mysecrettoken
```

Requests to `/keytab` must then include:

```
Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken
```

Requests without a valid token receive `401 Unauthorized`. `/healthz` is always unauthenticated — Docker's `HEALTHCHECK` depends on it.

> **CI note:** The integration tests in this repo retrieve the keytab via `docker exec`, not the HTTP endpoint, so `KDC_HTTP_TOKEN` has no effect on the built-in test suite.

---

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Unit tests only — no Docker required, runs in ~0.1 s
pytest tests/unit/ -q

# Single test
pytest tests/unit/test_samba_config.py::test_username_map_script_always_present -q

# Integration tests — Docker must be running
# On Windows, use a non-privileged port and add the hosts entry first
SMB_PORT=4450 KDC_PORT=8800 docker compose up -d
SMB_SKIP_COMPOSE=1 SMB_PORT=4450 KDC_PORT=8800 pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Kerberos requirement: the SMB hostname must resolve locally
echo "127.0.0.1  smbserver.smbtest.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

## Security

### Hardening applied

| Area | What's done |
|------|-------------|
| **Base image** | [Chainguard Wolfi](https://wolfi.dev/) — daily CVE patches, minimal attack surface, near-zero known CVEs |
| **SMB protocol** | SMBv1 disabled; SMBv2 minimum enforced |
| **NTLM** | NTLMv1 disabled; NTLMv2 only |
| **Server signing** | `mandatory` when anonymous access is disabled; `auto` otherwise (guest sessions cannot sign) |
| **Anonymous restrictions** | `restrict anonymous = 2` when anonymous disabled — blocks unauthenticated info queries |
| **Valid users** | Enforced per share when anonymous is disabled |
| **Fingerprinting** | `server string` is blank; browseable shares hidden |
| **Setuid/setgid** | All setuid/setgid bits stripped at image build time (`chmod a-s`) |
| **Capabilities** | `cap_drop: ALL` + selective `cap_add` (only what each daemon strictly needs) |
| **Privilege escalation** | `no-new-privileges: true` on both containers |
| **Process limits** | `pids_limit: 100` (KDC) / `200` (Samba) |
| **Resource limits** | CPU and memory limits set in compose |
| **KDC admin port** | Port 749 (kadmind) not exposed on the host — internal Docker network only |
| **Keytab auth** | Optional bearer token for the `/keytab` HTTP endpoint (`KDC_HTTP_TOKEN`) |
| **Multi-arch** | `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` — no emulation layers in production |

### Automated CI security checks

The following checks run automatically on every push and pull request, and on a weekly schedule:

| Check | Tool | What it catches |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Python SAST | [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) | Injection, path traversal, insecure deserialization, and other CWE-class bugs |
| Python security linter | [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) | Hardcoded secrets, shell injection, insecure subprocess use, weak crypto |
| Container CVE scan | [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) | Known CVEs (CRITICAL/HIGH) in base image and packages; results in GitHub Security tab |
| Dockerfile linting | [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) | Dockerfile best-practice violations and shell mistakes in `RUN` instructions |
| IaC security scan | [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) | Misconfigurations in Dockerfile and docker-compose |
| CIS Docker Benchmark | [Dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle) | CIS benchmark violations in built images |
| Supply chain health | [OSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev) | Branch protection, dependency pinning, CI security, signed releases |
| Dependency updates | [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) | Automated PRs for pip packages, Docker base images, and GitHub Actions |

### What automated testing does NOT cover

Automated scanning does not replace a full security assessment. The following are explicitly out of scope for the built-in CI:

- **Runtime / dynamic analysis (DAST)** — no fuzzing, no traffic interception, no active exploitation attempts against a live container.
- **SMB protocol-level attack simulation** — NTLM relay, Pass-the-Hash, Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting, and similar attack paths are not tested.
- **Network-layer hardening** — firewall rules, TLS termination, and host-level access controls are your responsibility.
- **Secrets management** — credentials passed via environment variables are visible via `docker inspect`. This project does not enforce Docker secrets or a secrets manager; that is your operational responsibility.
- **Penetration testing** — no automated pen-test runs against the deployed stack.
- **Compliance auditing** — no CIS benchmark, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, or similar compliance checks.
- **Seccomp / AppArmor profiles** — no custom syscall filtering beyond `no-new-privileges` and capability drops.

> [!WARNING]
> ### Your security responsibility
>
> **This is a developer test tool. It is not hardened for production.**
>
> Before deploying `smb-mock` in any shared, networked, or production-adjacent environment:
>
> - **Engage your application security team** to review the configuration and deployment context.
> - **Engage your red team** to evaluate the running stack against your threat model — including SMB relay attacks, credential exposure via `docker inspect`, and network reachability of the KDC and SMB ports.
> - **Change all default passwords** (`testpass`, `adminpass`) via env vars.
> - **Disable anonymous access** (`SMB_ENABLE_ANONYMOUS=false`) unless required for your test scenario.
> - **Do not expose port 445 or 88 to the public internet** with default credentials under any circumstances.
> - **Pin to a specific image tag** rather than `latest` in any non-ephemeral environment.
>
> No automated scan, no static analysis tool, and no CI badge is a substitute for human security review of your specific deployment. **The maintainers accept no liability for any security incident, data loss, or unauthorized access arising from use of this software.** See the [MIT License](LICENSE) for the complete disclaimer.

## Supply chain security

All published images are signed and carry an attached SBOM and build provenance attestation.

### Verify image signature (cosign)

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="https://github.com/ownjoo/smb-mock" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  ownjooorg/mock-kdc:latest
```

### Verify build provenance (GitHub)

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ownjooorg/mock-kdc:latest \
  --owner ownjoo
```

### Fetch the SBOM

```bash
cosign download sbom ownjooorg/mock-kdc:latest
```

SBOM files (SPDX JSON) are also attached to every [GitHub release](https://github.com/ownjoo/smb-mock/releases).

### GitHub Actions pinning

All GitHub Actions in this repository are pinned to immutable SHA hashes rather than mutable tags. [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) automatically opens PRs to keep pins current.

---

## Cross-realm trust (v1.1)

Trust relationship configuration is schema-complete and the env var contract is defined:

```
SMB_TRUST_0=CORP.EXAMPLE.COM:kdc.corp.example.com:sharedsecret:one-way
```

Full implementation (krbtgt principal creation, capaths, username mapping) is tracked for v1.1. Integration tests exist as `xfail` stubs.
